It's not so hard to forget
When your mind's as wicked as it is
I was sucked in, I believed you then
As much as I hate to admit
I could feel it seeping out of your wicked, olive skin
I'm still listening to our Menzingers record
Except song five off of it

I hope he misses you
And listens just like I do
You know it's no good for you
You know he's no good for you
And I'm trying to let this go
You're shaking and it shows
You know it's no good for you
You know he's no good for you

And darling, tell me where did your heart go?
Cause I sure as hell don't know
Know where your head's at anymore
Do you know what it feels like?
Being stuck between two colors on a palette
You're not happy with, you're afraid to mix
So you keep them apart and

I hope he misses you
And listens just like I do
You know it's no good for you
You know he's no good for you
And I'm trying to let this go
You're shaking and it shows
You know it's no good for you
You know he's no good for you

No good for you
No good for you
No good for you
And yeah I'm worked up
You are the sunlight blinding my face
The storm that's blocking my way
I need you out of my veins
I need you out of my veins

I hope he misses you
And listens just like I do
You know it's no good for you
You know he's no good for you
And I'm trying to let this go
You're shaking and it shows
You know it's no good for you
You know he's no good for you
